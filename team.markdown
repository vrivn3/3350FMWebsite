    <h3>Daniel</h3>
    <p>In this project I gained experience on planning from the ground up. And the importance of clear communication and common goals for the team before jumping into the project. I learned about the 3-tier architecture, and designing useful user stories. I also gained experience with testing particularly with JUNIT. Evaluating iterations and discussing how to move forward proved invaluable to making sure we worked together well and were supported by one another.</p>

    <h3>Harkeet</h3>
    <p>I gained experience in developing an Android project with a 3-tier architecture from scratch, how to plan each iteration of the project technically and non-technically, and applied my understanding of SOLID and design patterns such as dependency injection and adapter through my code. I also gained experience in testing each layer of our architecture effectively through unit, integration, and acceptance testing using third party technologies such as JUnit, and Espresso.</p>

    <h3>Sa√Øda</h3>
    <p>I really enjoyed the development process. Building 3350FM was challenging yet rewarding. I have learned the importance of the tiered architecture and adhering to good design principles when writing code. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in team collaboration and reading legacy code..</p>

    <h3>Thomas</h3>
    <p>While working on this project I gained experience adding full features to legacy code and adapting to the code as needed to implement the new features. I also gained experience in the three-tier approach to development. Creating test suits and making sure the features being added are properly tested was another thing I learned. Also, I learned a lot from planning and working together with other team members about how to work well with a team and making sure that everything goes smoothly.</p>
