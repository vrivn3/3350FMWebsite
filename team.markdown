    <h3>Harkeet</h3>
    <p>I gained experience in developing an Android project with a 3-tier architecture from scratch, how to plan each iteration of the project technically and non-technically, and applied my understanding of SOLID and design patterns such as dependency injection and adapter through my code. I also gained experience in testing each layer of our architecture effectively through unit, integration, and acceptance testing using third party technologies such as JUnit, and Espresso.</p>

    <h3>Sa√Øda</h3>
    <p>I really enjoyed the development process. Building 3350FM was challenging yet rewarding.

    <h3>Thomas</h3>
    <p>While working on this project I gained experience adding full features to legacy code and adapting to the code as needed to implement the new features. I also gained experience in the three-tier approach to development. Creating test suits and making sure the features being added are properly tested was another thing I learned. Also, I learned a lot from planning and working together with other team members about how to work well with a team and making sure that everything goes smoothly.</p>
